I"­<p>Hello. Iâ€™m Elian, or nail-e, and this is my blog.</p>

<p>A blog to collect and share all my tech/nerd ideas was something Iâ€™ve always had in mind but couldnâ€™t get around doing but finally, after months of deliberation and mental preperation, I finally got some HTML running, stripped and rewrote CSS, hacked stylesheets online and collated all my posts ideas on Obsidian to be uploaded here.</p>

<p>Stay tuned :)</p>
